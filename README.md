# Cody Rogers Apt Deco Technical Interview

Hello! I created this using Create React App and decided to use TailwindCSS for my styling
library and FontAwesome for the icons.

It should be responsive to the browser resizing and has an adjustable product count input that
will continue creating entries from the static product list indefinitely, looping from the beginning
of the list once the end is reached.

I look forward to hearing from you soon!
